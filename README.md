# Mobile-App-for-Agro-Tourism
This project aims to connect tourists and farm-houses for fostering agro-tourism.

Many local governments have plans to expand agro-tourism in order to boost the rural economy. Sub-urban areas have a large white-collar population who may be intereseted in visiting farm-houses as a tourist. Agro-IT app will allow us to connect these people and support growing rural business oppurtunities
